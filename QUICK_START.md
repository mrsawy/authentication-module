# Quick Start Guide ðŸš€

## TL;DR - Get Running in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Generate Lock Files
```bash
# Windows
.\setup.ps1

# Linux/Mac
chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh

# Or use make
make setup
```

### Step 2: Start Docker
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 3: Access Your Apps
- Frontend: http://localhost:3001
- Backend: http://localhost:3000
- API Docs: http://localhost:3000/api/docs

## What Just Happened?

The setup script:
1. âœ… Installed pnpm (if needed)
2. âœ… Generated `pnpm-lock.yaml` files for both client and server
3. âœ… Installed all dependencies locally

Docker Compose:
1. âœ… Started MongoDB on port 27017
2. âœ… Started Redis on port 6379
3. âœ… Started NATS on ports 4222, 8222
4. âœ… Built and started NestJS server on port 3000
5. âœ… Built and started Next.js client on port 3001

## Common Commands

```bash
# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Restart everything
docker-compose restart

# Check service health
make health

# Clean everything and start fresh
make clean && make setup && make up
```

## Troubleshooting

### "pnpm-lock.yaml not found"
Run the setup script first:
```bash
make setup
```

### "Port already in use"
Check what's using the ports:
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3001

# Linux/Mac
lsof -i :3000
lsof -i :3001
```

### "Cannot connect to Docker daemon"
Make sure Docker Desktop is running.

### Reset Everything
```bash
# Stop and remove everything
docker-compose down -v

# Remove all Docker data
docker system prune -af --volumes

# Re-setup
make setup
make up
```

## Development Mode

For hot-reload during development:
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

## Testing

```bash
# Test server
cd apps/server && pnpm test

# Test client
cd apps/client && pnpm test

# Or use make
make test-all
```

## Next Steps

1. Register a new user at http://localhost:3001/signup
2. Login at http://localhost:3001/login
3. Explore the API at http://localhost:3000/api/docs
4. Check NATS monitoring at http://localhost:8222

Happy coding! ðŸŽ‰
